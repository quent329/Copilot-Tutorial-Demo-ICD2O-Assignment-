## Instructions for Demo1.py

In the Demo1.py file, write a function with two parameters, width and height, for a rectangle. 
The function must return/print out the area of the rectangle once the two parameter values have been given.

## Instructions for Demo2.py

In the Demo2.py file, write a program that checks if the sum or difference of two variables,
a and b, is positive or negative and even or odd. 

## Instructions for Demo3.py

In this file, define a function that prints you back a letter grade based off of a number from 0-100.
If the number is <= 90, the grade is an A, if it is 80-89, the grade is a B, if it is 70-79, the grade 
is a C, if < 70, it is prints "fail".

## Instructions for Demo4.py

In this file, create a function with two parameters, a and b, that follows the Pythagorean Theorem. 
However, instead of C squared, the program must just return C itself (Hint: You will need to import math).

## Instructions for Demo5.py

In this file, create a function is_palindrome that is printed true if an inputed string has the same letters
front and back.
